# ISS-Tracker

## Inspiration

We wanted to create an All-In-One place to fill all of your space queries, help you see the location of the ISS and see our amazingly designed website so that you feel connected to the Universe around you.

## What it does

The Space trivia chatbot utilizes Google Cloud Dialog Flow and Chat GPT API to create a chatbot that can answer space-related trivia questions, providing a fun and interactive way to learn about space. The space-themed website, on the other hand, uses Wix to create a visually appealing and informative website that features images, videos, and articles about space exploration. The ISS tracker, which uses Google Cloud Functions to build an API, allows people to track the current location of the International Space Station. Lastly, the use of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to transcribe audio recordings from astronauts on the ISS serves as a tool that can aid researchers and scientists in their space-related work

## How we built it

To build the Space trivia chatbot, we utilized Google Cloud Dialogflow and ChatGPT API. For the Space-themed website, we used Wix, a user-friendly website builder that allowed us to create a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate website. We curated high-quality images, videos, and articles related to space exploration to provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of the subject. To build the ISS tracker, we utilized Google Cloud Functions, which allowed us to create an API that tracks the current location of the International Space Station in real time. Finally, we used Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to create a tool that transcribes audio recordings from astronauts on the ISS, allowing researchers and scientists to gain insights and extract valuable data from the recordings

## Challenges we ran into

While building this project, we faced a few challenges along the way. When building the ISS tracker, we had to deal with the challenge of accessing real-time data and ensuring that the API functioned correctly. Finally, when building the tool that transcribes audio recordings from astronauts on the ISS, we had to ensure that it could accurately convert spoken words into text, even in noisy environments.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the accomplishments we have achieved With the Space trivia chatbot, we created an engaging and informative tool that can answer a vast range of space-related trivia questions accurately. The chatbot utilizes Google Cloud Dialogflow and ChatGPT API, With the ISS tracker, we built an API that tracks the real-time location of the International Space Station, which is a remarkable achievement. Finally, with the tool that transcribes audio recordings from astronauts on the ISS, we provided researchers and scientists with a valuable resource to extract insights and data from audio recordings in noisy environments.

## How we used GitHub
We used github to host our ISS Tracker and make changes to it:
